Homework project I did recently, to show concept of parsing a CSV end to end with mostly JavaScript comparing it with a flat file db (note the method of parsing over the flat file is completely for concept only never should it be used in practice)


Note this doesn't work with IE, it doesn't make use of IE's built in mechanism to create a BLOB

Makes use of ReactJS
